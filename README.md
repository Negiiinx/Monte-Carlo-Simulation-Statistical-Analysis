Overview: This project aims to simulate and analyze patient flow within a hospital and clinic setting to optimize operations and improve efficiency. By leveraging detailed simulations, we can identify key performance metrics, compare different system configurations, and provide actionable recommendations for enhancing healthcare delivery.


Initialization: Parameter Setup: Define simulation parameters for hospital and clinic operations, including Poisson distribution for patient entry with a mean of 21, etc.

Simulation: Patient Flow Modeling: Simulate the process of patient entry, service, and exit in both hospital and clinic environments.
Data Collection: Gather detailed metrics on patient wait times, service times, and overall time spent in the system.
Comparison and Analysis:

System Comparison: Simulate alternative clinic configurations and compare performance metrics to identify the most efficient system.

Data Analysis: Calculate key performance indicators such as average wait times and service times. Analyze trends and identify bottlenecks in the system.
Visualization: Create visual representations of the collected data to facilitate understanding and communicating results.
